# Musinect
Musical stairs is a project which combines the depth analysis from a kinect and the music software: python-mingus to emulate real "musical stairs".
This is meant to run on a raspberry pi, however, with some configuration, it could be run on almost any system.

## Getting Stared
You must have python 2.7 installed, as well as pip installed.
1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/CADemons/kinect-musical-stairs.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned folder: `$ cd kinect-musical-stairs`
3. Install the dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Clone `settings-template.ini` to `settings.ini` 
5. Edit `settings.ini` with your preferences
6. Run `musical_stairs.py`
