Harmonect is `________`. It is currently in it's alpha phase of development. 

Harmonect makes use of the freenect python library, python-mingus, and an Xbox 360 Kinect to emulate "musical stairs" or other musical pathway. Harmonect is intended to be optimized to run on a Raspberry Pi with no delay or sound issues, however, with some configuration, Harmonect could be run on almost any system.

Thoroughly tested systems include:
- macOS

Currently, Harmonect is meant to be a standalone application. However, in the future, it could be used with other libraries.
